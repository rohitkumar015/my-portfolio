        After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I decided to pursue
        my passion for Web Development. I dedicated myself and learned frontend
        web development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving
        aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a
        problem. My core stack is React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am currently
        looking for a full-time position as a software developer.

      When I'm not
        coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and playing
        Cricket. I also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning about
